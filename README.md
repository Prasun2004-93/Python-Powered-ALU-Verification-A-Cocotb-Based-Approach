# Python-Powered-ALU-Verification-A-Cocotb-Based-Approach
üìù Project Description
This project involves the design and verification of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using:

Verilog HDL for RTL implementation (16-bit and 32-bit ALU).

Python with Cocotb for functional verification (testbench automation).

The ALU supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and shift operations, with status flags for Zero, Carry, Overflow, and Negative results. The verification leverages Python‚Äôs flexibility to streamline testbench development and debugging.

üöÄ Setup & Simulation 
Python 3.6+
Cocotb (pip install cocotb)
Verilog simulator (Icarus Verilog/ModelSim)
GTKWave (for waveform viewing)
